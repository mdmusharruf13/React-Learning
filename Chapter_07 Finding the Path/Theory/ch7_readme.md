# Finding the Path

__Note :__ useState is a hook which react gives you to create local state variables inside your functional components.

### Imp Points:   
+ Never ever write useState inside your if-else.
+ Never write useState inside for-loop
+ Don't create components inside another component.
+ Never use useState out side your functional component.
